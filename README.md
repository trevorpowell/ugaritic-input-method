Unicode input methods for Ugaritic on Mac and Windows

# Mac
- Download "Ugaritic.dmg" and mount the disk image
- Move "Ugaritic.keylayout" and "Ugaritic.icns" into "Keyboard Layouts"
- Open "System Preferences" -> "Keyboard" -> "Input Sources"
- Click the "+" to add a new input method and under "Others" choose "Ugaritic"

# Windows
- Download "Ugaritic.zip" and unzip the archive
- Run "setup.exe" to install
- For now at least, the input method installs as "English (United States) Ugaritic keyboard" as it has to attach to an existing Windows language
- You may need to log out and log back in after installing the input method
